Students in a class I am currently teaching can sign up for office hours without permission. Any of my formal research advisees can sign up at any time without permission. Any Berkeley PhD student in Economics, Haas, or ARE can sign up once without permission, but should email me to ask before signing up for additional meetings. All others should email to ask for permission to sign up for office hours.
