      Why do voters exposed to localized economic shocks not support left-wing parties? I argue that the center-left party's pivot to new middle-class voters can account for this pattern. Drawing on local- and individual-level data spanning the past 50 years in the UK and using a shift-share approach, I show that local exposure to deindustrialization shocks increased support for Labour in the 1970-80s, when Labour remained loyal to traditional manufacturing industries. This electoral support was accompanied by increasing support for redistribution and social benefits for the unemployed. However, as Labour began to pivot towards growing service and knowledge-based industries in the 1990s, deindustrialization shocks no longer translated into a leftward shift. To shed light on mechanisms behind this change, I show that the reversal in voter responses mainly took place in constituencies exposed to New Labour candidates. I do not find evidence supporting alternative mechanisms that emphasize voters' conservative attitudes, the supply of radical right parties, or the decline of trade unions.

      While phasing out coal is essential to address climate change, fossil fuel-dependent communities with limited alternative industries may face significant distributional costs. Drawing on regional-level data from European Parliament elections and individual-level survey data, this paper examines the political consequences of coal-fired power plant closures across 15 European countries between 2005 and 2019. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, I find that closures reduce support for parties advocating green transitions in EP elections. Furthermore, combining local- and individual-level data, I provide evidence that dissatisfaction with local public services may underpin this backlash. These findings suggest that regional economic losses from coal phase-out are often attributed not only domestically but also to EU-level policymaking, highlighting the need for EU-wide policies to compensate communities for lost tax revenues to sustain international cooperation for green transitions.

      Why do some economic shocks generate leftward electoral shifts while others lead to rightward shifts? This paper argues that the types of shocks and the associated credibility of compensation matter. Transitory shocks strengthen voters’ demand for redistribution and this demand has been met by the supply of short-term compensation policies typically from left‐wing parties. While permanent shocks also increase demands for redistribution, in addition they heighten the salience of threats to social status and fuel nativist attitudes. When long‐term compensation is perceived as inadequate and less credible, the status concern tends to dominate voting decisions. I test empirical implications of this theory with multiple survey datasets. First, I present evidence that cyclical recessions tend to be perceived as transitory and structural changes like skill-biased technological change and deindustrialization are perceived as permanent. Second, I create a novel measure of transitory and permanent shocks using the German socioeconomic panel and show that they are distinctively associated with voting for radical left- and radical right parties.
